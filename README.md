# pyodbc-duplicate-differentiate

This is a template that can be used to retrieve data from a SQL Server database, check a constructed column for duplicates, then create unique values to differentiate each of those duplicates. The script then updates the original rows with your new updated values.

I intend to use this as a template for similar scripts going forward. While it has a fairly specific use-case at the moment, it's a good starting point for other work.
